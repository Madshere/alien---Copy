Creating a scene using Three.js:

Three.js is a powerful library that can be used to create interactive and immersive 3D experiences on the web. One of the first things you need to do when using Three.js is create a scene. A scene in Three.js contains all the objects (such as meshes, lights, and cameras) that you want to display.

To create a scene in Three.js, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Define the size of the canvas that you will be rendering to:

var canvasWidth = window.innerWidth;
var canvasHeight = window.innerHeight;

2. Create a renderer:

var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({antialias: true});
renderer.setSize(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 1);

3. Create a camera:

var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, canvasWidth / canvasHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.set(0, 0, 5);

4. Create a scene:

var scene = new THREE.Scene();

Once you have set up your scene, you can start adding objects to it. For example, the code below adds a cube to the scene:

var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
var cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

Finally, you will need to render the scene. This is done using the following code:

renderer.render(scene, camera);
