On Monday May 1, 2023, we decided to develop a mobile app featuring calming virtual alien pets that users can adopt and care for by feeding, playing games, and interacting with them through touch and voice commands. We also decided to implement virtual 3D guided breathing and grounding techniques that users can customize, while the pets offer relaxing sounds and visuals. Additionally, we will use the GPT-3.5 powered agent for delegation and completion of simple tasks, such as setting up user accounts or handling customer inquiries. We will create virtual alien pets with different personalities and behaviors that users can interact with through touch and voice commands. We will create interactive features that allow users to feed, play games, and communicate with their pets and ensure that they are user-friendly and accessible for all users. Finally, we will implement virtual 3D guided breathing and grounding techniques that users can customize and that are appropriate and safe for all users.
