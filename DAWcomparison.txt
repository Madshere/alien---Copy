Ableton Live features unique workflows for recording, editing and arranging MIDI clips, and more. It has a host of built-in instruments and effects, and its Max for Live integration allows users to create custom plugins and automate tasks. FL Studio, on the other hand, is renowned for its step sequencer, piano roll, and playlist function, which allow for quick experimentation with patterns and sequencing.
